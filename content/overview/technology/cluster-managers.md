These tools address different and complementary models to the platform-as-a-service workflow we are supporting, like domain microservices and service discovery.

In our research, we have found government agencies typically aren’t in a state where they’re ready for broad and direct deployment of services using those models. We feel the PaaS model is better suited to the most common problems observed in government agencies today.

That said, these are powerful tools that we may incorporate in the future, either by exposing them directly, or building services on top of them. We are monitoring the needs we encounter in working on 18F Delivery projects, and will adopt this tech when it will provide a capability we’re in need of to deliver a project not otherwise achievable. Meanwhile we will continue to watch as the community and standards (eg Open Container Initiative) develop.

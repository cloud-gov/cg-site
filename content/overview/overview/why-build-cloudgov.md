The law and federal agency requirements describe a long list of good practices for government digital services. But there is no accompanying tooling support for implementers, so delivering and deploying an app requires a lot of work. An agency needs operations expertise to follow all the regulations, manage the ATO process, and design a robust service infrastructure.

As 18F scaled up the number of teams deploying applications at any given time, we wanted to avoid turning cloud operations talent into the kind of bottleneck that slows down development for many federal teams. We focused on technical operations that could act as force-multipliers for each team, enabling our cloud ops staffers to focus on solving new problems.

The arrival of cloud.gov has enabled 18F to deploy cloud-based applications with baseline security and scalability concerns addressed consistently, right up front, without dramatically scaling the number of cloud operations experts in our organization.

We understood that if working with open source solutions (always 18F’s first choice) did not work out, we would have the option to try a commercial PaaS option later. Our experience with open source options indicates this is the right choice for us. However, vendor PaaS options offer features which may be attractive to agencies that have different requirements.

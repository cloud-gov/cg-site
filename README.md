## 18F CF Docs

This repository contains the site code for the 
18f Cloud Foundry documentation site.

### Running the site locally

This project uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to build the site.

Once hugo is installed just run `hugo server -w` and browse to [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).

### Contributing

Hugo uses markdown to build the pages. Just add your page to the section you want inside the 
content folder.


### Acknowledgement

The theme for the site has been "forked" from the [Hugo documentation site](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/).

      <p class="section-displaytext">cloud.gov gives federal agencies a fast and easy way to host and update websites (and other web applications, such as APIs), so employees and contractors can focus on serving agency missions instead of wrangling the infrastructure and security compliance requirements common to federal information systems.</p>

      <p class="section-displaytext">cloud.gov has a Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) at the Moderate impact level from the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB). Any agency can use this P-ATO as part of their ATO for their systems built on cloud.gov. Because cloud.gov takes care of a substantial number of compliance requirements, each new system built on cloud.gov only needs to implement and document compliance for the remaining controls that their application handles.</p>

       <p class="section-displaytext">Imagine a secure cloud environment where your team can get up and running in minutes, then build, manage, and release applications with a radically shortened path to achieving Authority to Operate from your agency. This is cloud.gov.

        <p>
          To get the benefits of cloud hosting, like scalability and savings, you need cloud
          operations expertise, unless you’re using a Platform as a Service like cloud.gov.
          cloud.gov takes care of those operations and gives your team easy-to-use self-service tools to manage
          team member access, application resource and service usage, and application deployments. It’s flexible enough to give you
          what you need without sticking you with what you don’t. Let your team focus on building
          the applications you’re responsible for.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="three_up-part three_up-part-2">
        <h3 class="section-coltitle">Make compliance easier. Give your team their time back.</h3>
        <p>
          Launching digital applications for a federal agency requires lengthy documentation
          detailing your compliance with security standards. Creating these docs takes dozens of
          hours from developers, hours they can’t spend building features your users need. But
          with cloud.gov, you get Compliance as a Service, too. cloud.gov’s FedRAMP JAB P-ATO is fully
          documented, and you can leverage this P-ATO to automate huge parts of the process for
          yourself. Just document what you build on top of the platform. Could your team use the
          extra time?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="three_up-part three_up-part-3">
        <h3 class="section-coltitle">Take advantage of centrally-managed security.</h3>
        <p>
          Because cloud.gov enforces a consistent environment and gives each team a separate environment, no other team using the platform
          can change the environment in a way that hurts your security or compliance. Because
          every cloud.gov update applies to every application running on the platform, your team benefits
          from every improvement. Focus your security engineering resources on your custom application code while cloud.gov keeps the platform patched and monitored.

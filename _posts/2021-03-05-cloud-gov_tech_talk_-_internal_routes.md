title: Cloud.gov Tech Talk - Internal Routes
date: March 5, 2021
---
Join us on March 17 for a [tech talk to learn more about internal routes on Cloud.gov](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tech-talk-internal-routes-tickets-144475338627). Our engineers will show you how to use internal routes for secure, direct, container-to-container communication between applications.

Cloud.gov provides flexibility for controlling how traffic moves between applications. In this tech talk, we will highlight common use cases for internal routes (including links to samples) as well as discuss the considerations you need to account for. We will demonstrate how you can improve the security posture of your applications, without changing application code, using internal routes with the nginx buildpack.

This is a virtual event - a Zoom link will be provided 24 hours in advance of the event to all registered participants. Registration is required - [register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tech-talk-internal-routes-tickets-144475338627).

# Change Log 

## Before digging into the changes...

* Reminder: Please contact support@cloud.gov to schedule your RDS upgrades if you have not already done so. 
* The default amount of memory for staging applications has been increased from 1GB to 2GB to attempt to mitigate staging OOM issues.   Once we verify the recently deployed stemcells with the fix, we will be dropping it back down to 1 GB during upgrades next week. 
* As mentioned above there is a fix for the Out of Memory issue, which is live in production. The release 1.404 contains this fix: 
	
    >  The linux kernel has been changed from the HWE line of kernels back to the LTS line of kernels. Changing from the current 6.5 to 5.15. This is an attempt to mitigate [issue 318](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-linux-stemcell-builder/issues/318) where we see cgroups with memory limits hitting OOM errors when they previously did not under the 6.2 kernel versions

#### Known Issues

* During the upgrade to this version from UAA v76 or below with canary deployment (where briefly both new and old UAA servers could be running), UAA delete user endpoint might respond with an error even though the user deletion is successful. Mitigation: Delete users after the canary deployment finishes. But if you do run into this issue, you can ignore the error and check whether the user has been successfully deleted after the canary deployment finishes.

On March 31, the cloud.gov team kicked off our Tech Talk series in partnership with Digital.gov University. The series is designed to provide a deeper dialogue on the functionality of cloud.gov while providing guidance on ways to simplify and accelerate development using the platform.

The first guided demonstration, "[Intro to Cloud Foundry on cloud.gov](https://digital.gov/event/2020/03/31/intro-cloud-foundry-on-cloudgov/)", walks through the basics of using Cloud Foundry, an open source cloud application platform of which cloud.gov is built on. While this session focuses on developer interactions, it is ideal for anyone interested in how cloud.gov technology differs from other platforms and cloud offerings.

The second Tech Talk, "[cloud.gov for Product Managers](https://digital.gov/event/2020/04/22/cloudgov-for-product-managers/)" will take place on April 22. It will answer frequently asked questions about cloud.gov and provide context and guidance for how cloud.gov helps product teams deploy their applications. This webinar is intended for a non-technical audience. Register for the Tech Talk.

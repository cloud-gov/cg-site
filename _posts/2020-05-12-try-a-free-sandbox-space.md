The capabilities of cloud.gov are vast, and like many initial cloud.gov users, you may be unsure what access level best suits your team. In our experience, we have seen that users who sign up for a cloud.gov sandbox space have the ability to easily scale and adapt their work.

A [cloud.gov sandbox space](https://cloud.gov/docs/pricing/free-limited-sandbox/) is a free environment designed to allow you to run experiments and explore if cloud.gov suits your team’s needs. Our sandbox accounts are for testing; they’re suitable for information and applications that require no confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

Sandbox functionality is limited by design and the data wipes every 90 days. In comparison, a paid cloud.gov account includes full access to all services and environments for prototyping and production systems at FISMA Low and Moderate levels. Anyone with a U.S. federal government email address (ending in .gov, .mil, or .fed.us) can [sign up for a free sandbox space](https://account.fr.cloud.gov/signup).

[Try a sandbox space](https://cloud.gov/sign-up/) today, and explore the possibilities of utilizing a PaaS (platform as a service) created for the government by the government. Also, if you have any questions do not hesitate to send us a note at [inquiries@cloud.gov](mailto:inquiries@cloud.gov). We are happy to assist you in finding your place in the cloud.

date: March 08, 2023
excerpt: After reports of an open redirection vulnerability on cloud.gov Pages sites, we updated our platform's proxy to handle possible vulnerable requests.
---

On Tuesday March 7th, 2023, we received reports that cloud.gov Pages sites were susceptible to an open redirection vulnerability which could allow a nefarious actor to redirect users to phishing websites via crafted URLs. You can read about the NIST [CVE-2022-28923](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-28923) for more information. After verifying the reports, we released an update to our proxy in the afternoon of Tuesday March 7th, 2023 to handle any nefarious URL's with a 404 response. We also invalidated the CDN caches on customer's production domains to remove any potentially cached redirects.

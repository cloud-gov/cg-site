Curious what’s new that you might find helpful as a cloud.gov user? Here are highlights from our platform updates over the past two weeks.

### Added

* Space managers can [add any member of your organization to a space from the dashboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/apps/managing-teammates#space-users).
* Documentation for how to take [snapshots and restore backups of your ElasticSearch service data](https://github.com/cloud-gov/cg-site/blob/6418e8e933f887896a102d8575f1c7af468d1d2f/content/docs/services/elasticsearch24.md).
* All customers can now use [Oracle’s SE2 relational database]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/services/relational-database).

### Changed

* On the dashboard, new error messages alert you when you try to remove someone from your organization who still has roles in your spaces.

* Visualization of platform uptime available from the [cloud.gov status page](https://cloudgov.statuspage.io/). You can see current and the previous 90 days uptime for customer applications, API, dashboard, and many other components of the cloud.gov platform.

Check out our new page on [application maintenance]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/apps/app-maintenance). It explains how to restage your application and what else you should do to keep your app up to date and secure. Restaging will [incorporate fixes in the base filesystem](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/stacks.html#cli-commands) included with this release and ensure you’re running the most recent language version supported by your [buildpack](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/).

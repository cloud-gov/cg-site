title: Cloud.gov Pages Un-migrated User Policy
date: February 02, 2023
excerpt: Federalist users that have not migrated their accounts to cloud.gov
  Pages will no longer be able to migrate their account or access the platform
  starting April 2nd, 2023.

_*Note: This __DOES NOT__ apply to cloud.gov Pages users authenticating or logging into the platform at pages.cloud.gov with their email. Please disregard the following._

### Attention Federalist Users:

If you have not migrated your Federalist account to cloud.gov Pages via self-migration on pages.cloud.gov or through an invite to pages.cloud.gov, your account will be removed from the platform on 2023-04-02 (proposed). Our transition from Federalist to the FedRAMP authorized cloud.gov Pages means we will no longer support authenticating or logging into the system with GitHub. You will still connect your GitHub account to the cloud.gov Pages platform to build and add sites but this connection process will be a one time action within the cloud.gov Pages app.

After the deprecation date (2023-04-02), your existing account will be removed from the platform and will no longer be accessible to you. If a site you had access to is already in an organization, you will have to request an invite to cloud.gov Pages from that site’s organization manager. You can also regain access to the platform by requesting a sandbox account by emailing [pages-support@cloud.gov](mailto:pages-support@cloud.gov).

To avoid being impacted by this change, please login to pages.cloud.gov with your GitHub account and go through the self-migration process.

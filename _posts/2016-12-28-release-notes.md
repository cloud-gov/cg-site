Curious whatâ€™s new that you might find helpful as a cloud.gov application developer? Here are highlights from our platform updates over the past two weeks.
<!--more-->

### Added
- You can now create [S3 service keys]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/services/s3#get-s3-bucket-credentials) to get direct access to your cloud.gov S3 buckets.

### Changed
- We upgraded Cloud Foundry (the underlying open source project that powers cloud.gov) to [Release v250](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v250), which includes updates to buildpacks and improvements for internal components.

### Security
The Cloud Foundry upgrade included updates for the base filesystem used for running your application, addressing several security vulnerabilities in that filesystem. You can [restage your application](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/restage.html) to ensure you [incorporate fixes in the base filesystem](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/stacks.html#cli-commands) and are running the most recent language version supported by your [buildpack](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/).

- USN-3156-1: APT vulnerability. The associated CVE is CVE-2016-1252.

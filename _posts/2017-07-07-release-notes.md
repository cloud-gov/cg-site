Curious what’s new that you might find helpful as a cloud.gov application developer? Here are highlights from our platform updates over the past six weeks.
<!--more-->

### Added
* Organization managers can now [add new teammates to your org]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/apps/managing-teammates.md#give-roles-to-a-teammate) and manage user permissions right from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.fr.cloud.gov/).
* [cf-service-connect]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/services/relational-database.md#manually-access-a-database) now supports Windows. [See how to install it here.](https://github.com/18F/cf-service-connect#local-installation)

### Changed

- When you make a new service account or identity provider service instance, you will now [get the credentials using a service key]({{ site.baseurl }}/updates/2017-07-07-changes-to-credentials-broker.md), instead of getting the credentials from a Toaster (formerly Fugacious) link. This doesn’t change existing service account and identity provider instances, but you can delete and recreate them to use this new method.
- [Static IP addresses for communicating with external apps]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/apps/static-egress.md): Outbound traffic from cloud.gov now comes from specific IP addresses to help customers open up a connection between cloud.gov and outside data centers.
- We recommend you upgrade your Cloud Foundry CLI to [the latest version](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) to get the latest bug fixes.
- We improved the responsiveness of the dashboard to better reflect actions that happen on the backend.


### Platform releases

We upgraded the Cloud Foundry deployment to [v264](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v264). This upgrade addresses this security vulnerability: [CVE-2017-4994: Forwarded Headers in UAA](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/cve-2017-4994/).

You should [restage your application](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/restage.html) to [incorporate fixes in the base filesystem](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/stacks.html#cli-commands) and ensure you’re running the most recent language version supported by your [buildpack](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/).

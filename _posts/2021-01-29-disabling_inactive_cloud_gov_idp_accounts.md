title: Disabling inactive Cloud.gov IDP accounts
date: January 29, 2021
---
With an update to our [compliancy policy](https://github.com/cloud-gov/cg-compliance-docs/blob/master/AC-Policy.md), we will begin notifying and deactivating inactive accounts that use our Cloud.gov IDP for authentication. Our customers that use their agencies' credentials to authenticate into our platform will not be affected. Users that do not log into the platform within the past **90 days** will be deactivated.  We will send you email notifications **10 days** and **1 day** before deactivation instructing you to log into the platform to reset the **90 day** threshold.  If you are unable to log into the platform within the allotted time, you will need to email [support@cloud.gov](mailto:support@cloud.gov) to have your account reactivated.

Thank you from the Cloud.gov team.
